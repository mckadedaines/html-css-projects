        <p class="info-cinema">
            If you love watching movies or insane visual edits than you might just be interested in taking up Cinematography! For this hobby you will need two 
            things. One, a camera that can record videos, and two a video editing software. I recommend your phone to start off with as a camera and for a video 
            editing software I would use DaVinci Resolve which is completely free to use and is a major competitor to Adobe Premier Pro. There are a few tips that 
            I will give you to start off your cinematography journey! First tip would be to record and export your video in 24 frames per second (fps). The reasoning 
            for this is because when you or the audience is watching it makes it easier to pick up and show emotion and effects within that scene. Now if you want to 
            utilize slow motion in one of your scenes than I recommend recording in 60fps so that you can slow down the clip without there being an interference with 
            the film. Second tip would be to keep in mind what angle you are shooting at, a common role among everyone in the camera business is to shoot in the rule of 3rds. 
            Place the object you want to highlight in one of the 4 corners regarding the rule of 3rds. If you want to learn more about cinematography and how to shoot better shots, 
            or even learn cool visual effects than there are thousands of YouTube videos to help you get started!
