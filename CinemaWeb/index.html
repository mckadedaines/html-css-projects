        <h3 class="why">Why Photography and Cinematography?</h3>
        <p class="info">
            We at CinemaWeb get asked this question a lot, and all of us have different reasonings for it. But the most common 
        answer that you will receive from all photographers and cinematographers is that they love doing! They all share a passion for capturing
        a moment in time that has meaning, emotion, and drive behind it. There’s a reason on why there’s the phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words.” 
        It is the same thing with cinematography but more in depth and can portray emotions a little bit better. While that is the most common answer that you will 
        find behind most photographers and cinematographers answers you will also come across some that say the pay is good, or that they love to travel the world and 
        experience a whole new culture or reality. Both professions are meant to expand the view of what we see in the world, but we can view it in any size as well 
        as from multiple perspectives. So, what are you waiting for? Starting off can be as simple as taking videos or photographs on your phone! And, if you love the old 
        photo styles you see around than go ahead and pick yourself up a disposable camera and create a photo album of all your fondest memories and smiles!
