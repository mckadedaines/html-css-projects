      <h3>Why photography and cinematography?</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- Why should you try photography/cinematography? -->
	      We at (websites name) get asked this question a lot, and all of us have different reasonings for it. But the most common 
        answer that you will receive from all photographers and cinematographers is that they love doing! They all share a passion for capturing
        a moment in time that has meaning, emotion, and drive behind it. There’s a reason on why there’s the phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words.” 
        It is the same thing with cinematography but more in depth and can portray emotions a little bit better. While that is the most common answer that you will 
        find behind most photographers and cinematographers answers you will also come across some that say the pay is good, or that they love to travel the world and 
        experience a whole new culture or reality. Both professions are meant to expand the view of what we see in the world, but we can view it in any size as well 
        as from multiple perspectives. So, what are you waiting for? Starting off can be as simple as taking videos or photographs on your phone! And, if you love the old 
        photo styles you see around than go ahead and pick yourself up a disposable camera and create a photo album of all your fondest memories and smiles!

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
        A common misconception about photography is the cost of entry when wanting to pursue this as a hobby or career, and while we 
        must admit that camera equipment can become expensive taking photos can be as simple as just using your phone or a disposable camera you 
        can pick up at your nearest store. I personally started up on my iPhone when I decided to take on this monster of a hobby, and by doing 
        so I was able to develop the fundamental and basic skills to find success and enjoyment within the photography field. If you have a positive 
        perspective and an idea for a shot in mind than all you must do is pull out the camera or phone and start snapping away! As you become more detailed 
        with your photos you will start to get into wanting to edit them to portray a sign of warmth, cold, sadness, happiness, and many other emotions that 
        capture the audience’s heart. Now, while most people will use software from Adobe like Lightroom and Photoshop that will cost a good chunk of change you 
        can also use free software. I recommend Gimp, it is a completely free software that is a major competitor with Adobe Photoshop and many photographers still use 
        this software to produce professional grade photos for themselves and others.

      <h3>Cinematography</h3>
      <p>
        If you love watching movies or insane visual edits than you might just be interested in taking up Cinematography! For this hobby you will need two 
        things. One, a camera that can record videos, and two a video editing software. I recommend your phone to start off with as a camera and for a video 
        editing software I would use DaVinci Resolve which is completely free to use and is a major competitor to Adobe Premier Pro. There are a few tips that 
        I will give you to start off your cinematography journey! First tip would be to record and export your video in 24 frames per second (fps). The reasoning 
        for this is because when you or the audience is watching it makes it easier to pick up and show emotion and effects within that scene. Now if you want to 
        utilize slow motion in one of your scenes than I recommend recording in 60fps so that you can slow down the clip without there being an interference with 
        the film. Second tip would be to keep in mind what angle you are shooting at, a common role among everyone in the camera business is to shoot in the rule of 3rds. 
        Place the object you want to highlight in one of the 4 corners regarding the rule of 3rds. If you want to learn more about cinematography and how to shoot better shots, 
        or even learn cool visual effects than there are thousands of YouTube videos to help you get started!
