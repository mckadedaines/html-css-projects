        <h1 id="photo-heading">How to start taking photos?</h1>
        <p>
            A common misconception about photography is the cost of entry when wanting to pursue this as a hobby or career, and while we 
        must admit that camera equipment can become expensive taking photos can be as simple as just using your phone or a disposable camera you 
        can pick up at your nearest store. I personally started up on my iPhone when I decided to take on this monster of a hobby, and by doing 
        so I was able to develop the fundamental and basic skills to find success and enjoyment within the photography field. If you have a positive 
        perspective and an idea for a shot in mind than all you must do is pull out the camera or phone and start snapping away! As you become more detailed 
        with your photos you will start to get into wanting to edit them to portray a sign of warmth, cold, sadness, happiness, and many other emotions that 
        capture the audienceâ€™s heart. Now, while most people will use software from Adobe like Lightroom and Photoshop that will cost a good chunk of change you 
        can also use free software. I recommend Gimp, it is a completely free software that is a major competitor with Adobe Photoshop and many photographers still use 
        this software to produce professional grade photos for themselves and others.

        <img class ="elephant" src="images/elephant.jpg" alt="elephant">
        <p class="text">
            With the power of a photo editing tool you can make any color in the photographs
            stand out and really shine just like this Elephant!

        <p class="text">
            Lightning is to fast to photograph naturally. Try using faster
            shutter speeds to capture fast photos at the right moment.

        <p class="text">
            One of the best things about photos is capturing the emotion!
            Look at this baby looking at the camera all confused while holding
            fall leaves.
